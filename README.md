# DentalCaries
Predictive Modeling for Dental Caries Detection Using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This algorithm project involves the development of a machine-learning model aimed at predicting the likelihood of dental caries (tooth decay) using a synthetic dataset. The project is designed to demonstrate the application of various machine-learning techniques and methodologies that I have learned and applied in my studies and other projects. When faced with challenges during the development process, I actively sought out solutions by using Coursera, github and AI tools. This approach not only helped me overcome obstacles but also deepened my understanding of machine learning techniques and their applications in healthcare.

Disclaimer:
The dataset used in this project is entirely synthetic and was generated solely for the purpose of demonstrating my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and model evaluation. It is not based on real patient data and should not be used for any actual clinical or diagnostic purposes.

Features

Synthetic Data Generation:
A synthetic dataset was created to simulate patient demographics and dental health records. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, number of cavities, plaque score, fluoride use, and frequency of dental visits.
Machine Learning Model Development:
A Random Forest Classifier was utilized to build a predictive model that determines whether a patient is likely to have dental caries based on the synthetic data.

Model Evaluation:
The model was evaluated using various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
